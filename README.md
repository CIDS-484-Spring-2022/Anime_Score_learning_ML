Capstone project, for Machine learning anime review scores

# Overview
The main goal for this project is to scrap data using a python we scraper like beautiful soup to scrap information from the website https://myanimelist.net/.
After cleaning the data, the main goal is to create a machine learning model (linear regression) to find out which of the attributese of each show correlates to increase
scoring of the show and its reviews.
